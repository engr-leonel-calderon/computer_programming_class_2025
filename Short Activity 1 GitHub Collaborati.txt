Short Activity 1: GitHub Collaboration and Branching
Instructions

Team Formation
1. Select at least 2 classmates to be your collaborators.
2. Important: If you have already been selected as a collaborator by another classmate, you do not need to create your own repository or select additional collaborators. You can either be the repository owner who invites collaborators OR a collaborator who is invitedâ€”choose only one role.

Repository Setup---------------------------------------------------
3.The repository owner must add two collaborators to their GitHub repository.
4. Once added, all three members (owner + 2 collaborators) should create their own individual branches on GitHub.

Local Development-------------------------------------------------
5. On your local machine, each team member must:
-> Switch to their own branch
-> Add at least 2 different files (for example: a text file and a CSV file)
-> Push the changes to their respective branches on GitHub



Pull Request Workflow
First Collaborator:
6. The first collaborator will generate a pull request but should not merge it.
7. The repository owner should review and merge this pull request.
8. After merging, both the repository owner and the second collaborator should pull the changes from the main branch and push updates to their own branches.
Second Collaborator:
9. The second collaborator will now create a pull request but should not merge it.
10. The repository owner should review, approve, and merge this pull request.
11. Both the repository owner and the first collaborator should pull these changes and push updates to their own branches.
Repository Owner:
12. Finally, the repository owner will create their own pull request and approve it themselves. (Note: This is not best practice, but acceptable for this demonstration activity.)
13. Both collaborators should pull these changes and push updates to their own branches.

Expected Outcome
By the end of this activity, all branches (main branch and all three individual branches) should contain the same files added by each team member.
